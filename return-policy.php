Whether you’ve received a damaged product, an incorrect order, or you simply changed your mind, we are here to help with our comprehensive return policy.</p>

        <p>Please read our return policy carefully to understand the process, eligibility, timelines, and exceptions related to returning or exchanging a product. By purchasing from Pehunt, you agree to the terms outlined in this return policy.</p>

        <h2>1. General Eligibility for Returns</h2>

        <p>Products that do not meet the above conditions will not be accepted for return, and no refunds or exchanges will be provided in such cases.</p>

        <h2>2. Return Process</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Initiating a Return</h3>

            <li>Contact our customer support team at care@Pehunt.com to assist you with the return process.</li>

        <h3>Step 2: Approval of Return Request</h3>
        <p>Once your return request has been submitted, our customer support team will review the information provided and determine whether your request meets our return criteria. If your return is approved, you will receive a confirmation email with instructions for shipping the product back to us.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Shipping the Return</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for shipping the product back to us unless the product is defective or incorrect. Please follow the instructions provided in the return approval email, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Properly packaging the product to avoid damage during transit.</li>
            <li>Using a reliable shipping service that provides tracking and insurance. We are not responsible for lost or damaged packages during return shipping.</li>
            <li>Clearly labeling the return package with the return address and any return authorization number (if provided).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once your return has been received and inspected, you will be notified of the outcome (see section on Refunds for further details).</p>

        <h2>3. Refund Process</h2>
        <h3>Refund Eligibility</h3>
        <p>If your return is approved after our inspection, we will process your refund in accordance with the original payment method used to make the purchase. Refunds will generally be issued within 10 business days after the returned product is received and inspected.</p>

        <p>Please note that the following conditions may affect your refund:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shipping fees (including return shipping) are non-refundable unless the product was defective or incorrect.</li>
            <li>If the product is returned in a condition that does not meet our return eligibility criteria, you will not be eligible for a refund, and the product will be shipped back to you at your expense.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Refund Timelines</h3>
        <p>Depending on your payment method, refunds may take the following time to process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Credit/Debit Card:</strong> 5-10 business days after processing the refund.</li>
            <li><strong>PayPal:</strong> 3-5 business days after processing the refund.</li>
            <li><strong>Bank Transfer:</strong> 7-14 business days, depending on your bank’s policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the refund is delayed beyond the expected timeline, please contact our customer support team for further assistance.</p>

        <h2>4. Exchanges</h2>
        <p>We also offer exchanges for eligible products. If you wish to exchange a product for a different size, color, or model, please follow the same process for initiating a return as outlined above.

        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>In cases where the replacement product is unavailable, we may offer a store credit or refund instead of an exchange.</p>

        <h2>5. Non-Returnable Items</h2>
        <p>Certain items are not eligible for return or exchange due to their nature or other restrictions. These non-returnable items include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perishable goods (e.g., food, flowers, etc.)</li>
            <li>Personal care items (e.g., skincare, hygiene products, etc.) that have been opened or used.</li>
            <li>Custom-made or personalized items that were specially ordered or made to your specifications.</li>
            <li>Gift cards or promotional vouchers.</li>

            <li>Clearance or "Final Sale" items marked as non-returnable at the time of purchase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to carefully review the product details and ensure that the item meets your needs before making a purchase, especially for non-returnable items.</p>

        <h2>6. Defective or Damaged Products</h2>
        <p>If you receive a defective or damaged product, you are eligible for a refund or replacement at no additional cost. To report a defective or damaged product, please follow these steps:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Once the product is received and inspected, we will process your refund or ship a replacement to you as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>7. Incorrect Orders</h2>
        <p>If you receive an incorrect product (e.g., wrong item, wrong size, or color), please contact us immediately. We will correct the error by either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shipping the correct product to you at no additional cost.</li>
            <li>Issuing a refund or store credit if the correct product is unavailable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In such cases, we will cover the cost of return shipping for the incorrect product.</p>

        <h2>8. Return Shipping Costs</h2>
        <p>Unless otherwise specified (e.g., defective or incorrect items), return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer. We recommend using a trackable shipping method for your return to ensure that the product is received at our facility.</p>

        <h2>9. International Returns</h2>
        <p>If you are making a return from outside of India, please be aware of the following additional conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Return shipping fees for international orders are the responsibility of the customer.</li>
